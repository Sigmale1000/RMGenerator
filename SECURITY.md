# Security Policy :lock:

At RMGenerator, we take security seriously and strive to protect the personal information of our users.

## Data Collection and Use :bar_chart:

We collect minimal information from our users, such as their Github username and email address when they generate the readme. We use this information to provide better service and support. We do not share or sell any personal information with third parties.

## Data Storage and Transmission :floppy_disk:

All data collected by RMGenerator is stored securely on our servers. We use industry-standard encryption to protect data in transit and at rest.

## User Information Security :key:

Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their own information they used to generate the readme. We strongly recommend not sharing personal information with anyone and double checking the information before generating the readme.

## Third-Party Services :link:

RMGenerator may use third-party services to provide additional functionality. These services may have their own privacy and security policies, which we encourage our users to review.

## Reporting Security Issues :rotating_light:

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in RMGenerator, please contact us immediately at sigmadroide@gmail.com. We will investigate the issue and take appropriate action to resolve it.
